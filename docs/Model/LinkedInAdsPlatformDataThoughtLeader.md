------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**post_urn** | **string** | LinkedIn share or ugcPost URN, urn:li:share:N or urn:li:ugcPost:N. Get it via \&quot;Copy link to post\&quot; on the target LinkedIn post (the URL contains -share- for a share or -ugcPost- for a ugcPost, then the numeric id). The post must be authored by an organization (Company Page). Member (personal profile) posts, i.e. Thought Leader Ads proper, are rejected by LinkedIn&#39;s public Marketing API regardless of sponsorship approval and of post type (a LinkedIn limitation; their Campaign Manager creates those through a private API). Referencing a member post returns a 422 with a clear error. |
